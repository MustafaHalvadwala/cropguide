red,144,56,247,Redsoil Image,Ideal for Hardy and Drought-Resistant Crops,"Rich in iron, perfect for hardy crops!","Red soil, known for its iron content and good drainage, supports hardy crops that require minimal water. Millets thrive in its slightly acidic nature, while groundnuts grow well in its loose and aerated structure. Pulses like lentils, chickpeas, and pigeon peas adapt well with proper fertilization. Cotton can also be cultivated successfully in red soil with adequate irrigation and organic matter enrichment."
black,177,54,398,Blacksoil Image,Best for Moisture-Retaining Crops,Moisture-retaining and perfect for cotton!,"Black soil, or regur soil, has excellent moisture retention, making it perfect for crops that require consistent hydration. Cotton, the most suitable crop for black soil, benefits from its high clay content. Wheat grows well in well-drained black soil with proper fertility management. Soybean thrives due to the soil's ability to hold moisture, while sugarcane benefits from its deep, nutrient-rich nature, leading to high yield."
alluvial,230.15,114.67,196.75,Alluvialsoil Image,Perfect for Water-Intensive Crops,Water-retentive and great for rice cultivation!,"Clay soil has a fine texture and excellent water-holding capacity, making it ideal for moisture-loving crops. Paddy (rice) grows best in this soil as it requires standing water for extended periods. Legumes such as peas, beans, and lentils adapt well with proper drainage techniques. Banana plants thrive in moist clay soil with controlled water management, while sugarcane can also be cultivated with adequate irrigation and aeration to enhance root growth."
clay,185.7,11.36,237.37,Claysoil Image,Highly Fertile for Diverse Crops,Nature's gift for high-yield farming!,"Alluvial soil, found in river plains, is highly fertile and supports a wide variety of crops. Rice grows abundantly due to its water retention and rich mineral content. Wheat flourishes in well-drained alluvial soil, especially in cooler seasons. Sugarcane benefits from its nutrient-rich composition, while vegetables like potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, and onions thrive due to its excellent fertility and structure, making it ideal for high-yield farming."
