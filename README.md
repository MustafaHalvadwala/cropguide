## 🚀 Features

### ✅ **1. AI-Based Crop Recommendation**
- Predicts the **best crop** based on key soil properties:
  - **NPK values (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)**
  - **pH level**
  - **Rainfall, humidity, and temperature**
- Utilizes **machine learning algorithms** to ensure accurate crop selection for optimal yield.

### ✅ **2. Deep Learning-Powered Soil Type Detection**
- Uses a **deep learning model** to classify **soil types** based on image analysis.
- Enhances precision by aligning crop recommendations with **specific soil properties**.

### ✅ **3. Market-Driven Crop Optimization**
- Integrates **real-time market price tracking** to recommend crops that are both **agronomically suitable and financially profitable**.
- Ensures farmers grow **high-demand, high-profit crops** by analyzing **current market trends**.

### ✅ **4. Weather-Integrated Smart Suggestions**
- **OpenWeather API** fetches **real-time weather data**, considering:
  - **Temperature**
  - **Rainfall patterns**
  - **Humidity trends**
- Adapts recommendations based on **climatic conditions** to improve accuracy.

### ✅ **5. IoT-Enabled Smart Agriculture (Future Scope)**
- **IoT sensors** will provide real-time detection of:
  - **Soil nutrition levels**
  - **Moisture content**
  - **Weather conditions**
- **Automated data collection** will further enhance crop recommendation accuracy.
